Run with `py -m pykeyboardmelee`. Stop with CTRL-C

All code in `pykeyboardmelee/__main__.py` with comments.

TODO
- pypi release, and prep
  - eg pyproject.toml
- load layout from file if present
- a few different default layouts would be good
  - b0xx, frame1, etc
- gui / taskbar
  - onscreen keyboard rebinding. Key -> VKey
  - load from file with GUI
  - organize presets easily. This program should never connect to the internet to avoid becoming a keylogger. Downloads should be down in browser, then just click and drag the file onto the running program to add the file to the presets directory. There should be an easily swappable presets system.
